# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). It allows me to maintain, customise, and deploy my configuration files across multiple machines with ease.

## What is chezmoi?

chezmoi helps you manage your personal configuration files (dotfiles, like ~/.gitconfig) across multiple machines.

chezmoi provides many features beyond symlinking or using a bare git repo including:

- templates (to handle small differences between machines)
- password manager support (to store your secrets securely)
- importing files from archives (great for shell and editor plugins)
- full file encryption (using gpg or age)
- running scripts (to handle everything else)
